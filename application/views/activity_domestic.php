                            In non saturated markets we have established a local presence to import and supply directly to the local downstream operators and end-consumers. These activities are managed by our local teams supported by the financial, trading and risk-management capabilities of the group.

                            Since the estblishment of MADDOX we have been actively supplying the Georgian market with Diesel 10ppm, Gasoline RON 95 and RON 92 and other end-consumer products. In 2018 Maddox financed the construction of a inland Depot with a capacity of xxxxx cbm to receive end-consumer products by rail and re-distribute them by truck. In 2019 we established our own subsidiary in Tblisi to be able to better satisfy the needs of our local clients and to capture additional value by supplying to end-consumer.
