                            Our Business model is targeted to be close to our clients and to supply to end-consumer markets to capture additional margin along the value chain. To satisfy the markets we have established with the main actors in the individual market from subsidiaries of multi-national oil companies until independent privately owned downstream operators. For these clients we aim to be their access to the international markets to minimise supply costs and to maximize the downstream margin.
                            Over the past years we have been able to apply our Business Modell in following countries through own or rented storage locations that enables us to support the import business into these markets:
