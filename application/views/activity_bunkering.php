                        <p style="font-size: 19px; font-family: Arial;">

                            One of our core businesses is the supply of the international Bunkering Business with Marine Gasoil (MGO – Gasoil 0.1) in our hubs of Constanta (Romania) and Istanbul (SOM – Tukey). Over the years MADDOX created a number of long term cooperations with solid Bunkering Companies by supplying high quality product but also providing finance and risk-management solutions.
                          <br>  Going forward and with the implementation of IMO 2020 (very low sulphur bunker fuels) we aim to extent our activities in this segment significantly by adding VLSFO (0.5%) in our hubs to our clients and into the Mediterranean markets. For this expansion MADDOX has developed a long-term supply scheme of VLSFO from the Caspian Sea. By utilizing our excellent transport logistics we are able to provide a secure, all year around, supply of these products.
                         <br>   As MADDOX is not supplying directly to ship-owners we have been able to exclude a significant credit risk from our portfolio.
